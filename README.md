# My Portfolio

This is the code of my portfolio. The focus here is not to show everything I can do as a developer,
but to inform anyone interested who am I, where did I work, what was the main experiences I've went through,
and so on. So, it is as simple as it gets. The main stylish inspiration was, of course,
the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website, which is simple, pretty (in my opinion) and
do exactly what it propose itself to do.
